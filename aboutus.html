        <h2>What is DevOps?</h2>
        <p>
            DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. DevOps is complementary with Agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from Agile methodology.

            DevOps is required to improve the speed and efficiency of software development and deployment. It fosters a collaborative culture between development and operations teams, leading to better communication, more efficient processes, and a faster time to market. Some key benefits include:
